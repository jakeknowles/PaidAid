# PaidAid

Paid Aid is an Android Application that gives shopping a new feel. We created this application with our main goal of being to help out 
the millions of people with busy lifestyles, elderly, disabled, vehicle-less, and people who just don't have the right car for what 
they want to buy. Our vision was to create a new way of shopping/receiving things. This app allows users to post shopping requests, 
pick up shopping requests, and in return, get a cash tip. This app is functional currently but we are still always adding new features, 
finding bugs, and making it the best we can. Paid Aid is created in Java and designed with XML through Android Studio using PHP/JSON 
with mySQL for the backend. A Proposal, Mock-UI’s, User stories, and a video of the functionality we’ve implemented so far is completed. 
We are planning on continuing with Paid Aid and bringing it to the market in the near future.
